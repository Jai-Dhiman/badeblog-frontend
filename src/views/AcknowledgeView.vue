              Itâ€™s a story which has seen many ups and downs in its long journey. My first attempt
              to write a short-story was in my late teen years that could not be continued for my
              personal circumstances. Nonetheless, the thirst of commitment to ink the paper did not
              die and a spark somehow managed to appear before my eyes every now and then.

              When I came into the job, I noticed my interest rising; and I started composing poetry
              in free verse. My compositions got adequate appreciations from my colleagues and
              family members. Still, it could not be carried on, though I did try on and off.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-xl">
              After superannuation from job, I penned up many short-stories and poetry including
              traditional as well as free verse and two liners. My friends and family members were
              again inclined to admire them too much and continuously encouraged me to write more
              and have a compilation in any form, but destiny had decided some other path to be
              followed by me.

              My interest of writing re-instilled when I came to the USA to visit my elder son and
              daughter and their families; and my grand-daughter, Surbhi Dhiman, asked me to write
              on certain topics in English language, though my work carried out earlier is in Hindi
              language. With this, the issue of compilation of my compositions came up for
              discussion and for that this internet site is before you.

              I shall be doing injustice if I don't mention my grandson, Jai Dhiman. I am happy to
              say that this beautiful website has been developed. Thinking of it's design and
              awesome architecture took about a fortnight of his precious time. May God bless him.

              I take this opportunity to express my heart-felt gratitude to my colleagues, friends,
              my wife, sons, daughters-in-law, daughter, son-in-law, grandchildren and other
              promoters, and wish them all the best.
