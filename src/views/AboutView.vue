              I, Dhiman PR, author of the blogs herein come from a very ordinary family in a small
              township known as Samalkha in District Panipat, Haryana State in India. After
              completion of my schooling, I got an employment in a constitutional body in India
              called Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) in 1967 and retired from a responsible
              position in 2007.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-xl">
              I donâ€™t recall when I developed interest of writing things other than that related to
              the discharge of my official duties. As far as I remember it was in late second half
              of my service period that commenced with poetry writing till a little later after
              retirement from the job. Thereafter, I was off this passion for sometime for reasons
              beyond my control though off and on I tried to write subject to availability of time.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-xl">
              I came to US in 2024 to visit my eldest son, Sudhir and his family. Here, my
              granddaughter, Surbhi who was aware of this passion of mine wanted me to write on
              certain specific issues suggested by her and this again inculcated my interest in
              writing.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-xl">
              My past and current achievements include articles, essays, short stories, plays in
              Hindi as well as English languages; and poetry that includes couplets in the form of
              Dohe, Chaupais, Rubaiyan and other forms of poems in Hindi. I propose to publish them
              in the form of individual blogs in this website.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-xl">I hope readers will enjoy my work.</p>
